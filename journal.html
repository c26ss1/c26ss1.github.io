<h1>My Journal</h1>

<h3>Entry #1 10/3/22</h3>
<p>I think that Computer Science this year is going pretty well. I enjoy making the websites because it is visual and I can easily see my progress. I am looking forward for doing more work like this. </p>
<h3>Entry #2 10/11/22</h3>
<p>I enjoy making my website, it is cool to visualize your mistakes and progress. I am struggling with centering text, shapes, and images. I am a perfectionist when it comes to things like that, and it is hard to get alignment right. That being said, if I know what to look for, the internet is pretty helpful in solving coding issues. In the future I would like to expose myself to other parts of HTML and things to do. Right now, I feel pretty good with the basic stuff that we covered in class (divs, journals, and text), but I want to learn more so my websites can be more complex and functional. </p>
