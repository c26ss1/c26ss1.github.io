<h1>My Journal</h1>

<h3>Entry #1 10/3/22</h3>
<p>I think that Computer Science this year is going pretty well. I enjoy making the websites because it is visual and I can easily see my progress. I am looking forward for doing more work like this. </p>
<h3>Entry #2 10/11/22</h3>
<p>I enjoy making my website, it is cool to visualize your mistakes and progress. I am struggling with centering text, shapes, and images. I am a perfectionist when it comes to things like that, and it is hard to get alignment right. That being said, if I know what to look for, the internet is pretty helpful in solving coding issues. In the future I would like to expose myself to other parts of HTML and things to do. Right now, I feel pretty good with the basic stuff that we covered in class (divs, journals, and text), but I want to learn more so my websites can be more complex and functional. </p>
<h3>Entry #3 10/20/22</h3>
<p>I am having lots of trouble with images. I have tried to make it the background of my website and that failed. I have also tried to make the home button have a little icon instead of text and that didn't work too. I have also been having trouble with the animation and making it move. I made it move if it started from the div's original placement. However, as soon as I moved the div into my desired place(the bottom right corner), I cannot make it move arround. For both of the issues I have tried to fix them using the internet, but I have not found anything that fixed my problems. The answers are out there, I just don't know how to search for exactly what I am looking for. What is coming along well is my projects page. As of now on my c26ss1.github.io link, it just leads straight to the squares and nothing is there. But I have been working on something that I think is pretty cool, I just need to fix a few things before it is done. </p>
